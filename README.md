In today's interconnected world, social media platforms have become an integral part of our
lives, enabling us to connect, communicate, and share information on a global scale. These
platforms have revolutionized the way we socialize and stay connected with friends and family.
From Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to Snapchat and LinkedIn, social media has become an
essential tool for socializing, staying informed, and building relationships.

The success of social media platforms lies in their ability to provide seamless and efficient user
experiences. Behind the scenes, data structures play a crucial role in optimizing data retrieval
and storage, ensuring that users can access and share information quickly and efficiently. By
utilizing efficient data structures, social media platforms are able to handle large amounts of
user-generated content, facilitate real-time interactions, and deliver personalized
recommendations and content.

As computer programming enthusiasts, building a social media application has long been a
fascinating challenge. It requires a deep understanding of programming concepts, data
structures, algorithms, and database management. In this report, we delve into the creation of a
simplified mock Facebook project, implemented using the Java programming language, to
explore and demonstrate the fundamental concepts and techniques involved in building a social
media platform.

## Our Approach

The core functionalities of our mock Facebook project will include adding and searching for
friends, user access control, and other essential features commonly found in social media
platforms. These functionalities will be implemented by leveraging appropriate data structures
and algorithms that optimize performance and facilitate efficient data storage and retrieval.

To achieve our project goals, we will utilize various data structures such as arrays, linked lists,
etc., depending on the specific requirements of each feature.
